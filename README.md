# KafkaBasics
This project has my first implementation of a producer and consumer in Java. It pulls data from a public API (Wikimedia) and givers it to a producer. The producer sends the data to my Kafka topic and a consumer is also included to read the data.

# Key Points
1. Shows how to set up the properties of a Kafka Procuder and Consumer
2. Demonstrates high throughput and how Kafka can handle it given the proper resources
3. Includes basic usage of Kafka streams
